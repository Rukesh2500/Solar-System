    <p>The solar system has one star, eight planets, five officially named dwarf planets, hundreds of moons,
         thousands of comets, and more than a million asteroids.</p>

    <p>Our solar system is located in the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy with two major arms, and two minor
         arms. Our Sun is in a small, partial arm of the Milky Way called the Orion Arm, or Orion Spur, between 
         the Sagittarius and Perseus arms. Our solar system orbits the center of the galaxy at about 515,000 mph (828,000 kph). 
         It takes about 230 million years to complete one orbit around the galactic center.</p>
        
    <p>We call it the solar system because it is made up of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by
         gravity.</p>
<aside>
    <h3>Why Is It Called The "Solar" System?</h3>
    <p>The term "solar system" comes from "sol," which is the Latin word for the Sun. The system is called
         the "solar" system because it refers to the Sun and all the celestial bodies that orbit around it,
          including the planets, moons, asteroids, and comets. Essentially, it's named after the central star
           that holds everything together through its gravity.</p>

<h3><a href="https://science.nasa.gov/sun/">The Sun Facts</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Our Sun is a 4.5 billion-year-old yellow dwarf star – a hot glowing ball of hydrogen and helium – at the center of our solar system.</li>
    <li>It’s about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth and it’s our solar system’s only star.</li>
    <li>Without the Sun’s energy, life as we know it could not exist on our home planet.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Top 4 facts about our Solar System</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The Sun Dominates: The Sun makes up about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. It's so massive 
        that its gravity governs the orbits of all the planets and other objects.</li>
    <li>Jupiter’s Size: Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System. It’s so big that all the other 
        planets combined could fit inside it. Its Great Red Spot is a gigantic storm that has been raging for
         at least 400 years.</li>
    <li>Saturn’s Rings: Saturn is famous for its spectacular ring system, which is made up of ice, rock, and 
        dust particles. These rings are actually very thin, despite their vast width, and they are divided into
         several main rings and gaps.</li>
    <li>Earth’s Moon: Earth’s Moon is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System and is unusually
         large relative to the size of its host planet. The Moon’s gravitational pull affects Earth's tides, 
         stabilizes its axial tilt, and contributes to a more predictable climate.</li>
