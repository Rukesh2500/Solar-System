The **solar system** consists of the Sun and everything that orbits it, including eight planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune), their moons, dwarf planets (like Pluto), asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. The Sun, a star at the center, provides the gravitational force that keeps the system together.
